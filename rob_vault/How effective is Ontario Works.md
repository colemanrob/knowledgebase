> "a significant differential impact on both spell durations (time on social assistance) and oneand two-year return rates (return to social assistance)" ([Adams et al 2018:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=1))

> "emphasizing assignment to the programs that achieve its policy goals." ([Adams et al 2018:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=1))

> "eligibility" ([Adams et al 2018:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=2))

> "asset and income cut-offs and an agreement to participate in an active labour-market program" ([Adams et al 2018:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=2))

> "no limitations on the length of benefit-spells" ([Adams et al 2018:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=2))

> "Examining the program effects on spell duration gives an idea of the short-term efficacy of the programs: how effective they are at getting recipients employed." ([Adams et al 2018:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=2))

> "outcomes depend on the type of assistance provided." ([Adams et al 2018:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=2))

> "while a combination of such workshops and training or employment assistance through direct job placements increase the spell length" ([Adams et al 2018:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=3))

> "direct job placements have a statistically significant and economically meaningful effect on reducing the oneand two-year return rates." ([Adams et al 2018:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=3))

> "For example, the government could increase assignment to programs that lead to shorter spell durations if its goal was to get recipients off social assistance more quickly. Alternatively, it could increase assignment to programs that lead to lower probabilities of return to social assistance if its aim was focused more on longer-term labour-market attachment." ([Adams et al 2018:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=3))

> "the positive impact of programs such as jobtraining tends to be larger for the long-term unemployed (this would include Ontario Works recipients) and that many treatments that do not show short-term evidence of a statistically significant impact show positive mediumterm impacts." ([Adams et al 2018:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=3))

> "all three lead to statistically significant increases in employment compared to a control group of untreated EI claimants, with the effects becoming more pronounced over the medium term" ([Adams et al 2018:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=4))

> "this study is the first to examine their impact on recipients of social assistance." ([Adams et al 2018:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=4))

> "Many OW beneficiaries may have been ineligible to claim EI benefits following a job separation, and a common reason for joining OW is the exhaustion of EI benefits. The work of Brown and Koettl (2015) and Card, Kluve, and Weber (2010, 2015) suggests that this group could be differentially affected by these programs, so it follows that any policy aimed at improving the labour-market outcomes of social assistance beneficiaries should be based on evidence that is pertinent to them." ([Adams et al 2018:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=4))

> "The return rates for each program give the proportion of recipients that return to social assistance within, respectively, one year of leaving and two years of leaving." ([Adams et al 2018:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=8))

> "independent job-search program or placement services are, on average, more likely to return to social assistance within one year or two years after exit. By contrast, those assigned to structured job search, training programs, or both have a lower propensity of returning to unemployment after leaving Ontario Work" ([Adams et al 2018:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=8))

> "Being assigned to structured job search will, on average, reduce spell duration by approximately 1.7 months compared to recipients assigned to independent job search." ([Adams et al 2018:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=9))

> "However, being assigned to both these program categories (structured job search and a training program) adds 4.6 months to a spell - a significantly longer period than after assignment to only one of the programs." ([Adams et al 2018:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=9))

> "The average recipient is better off being assigned only to a training program rather than also being assigned to structured job search, or vice versa." ([Adams et al 2018:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=9))

> "being given a direct job or volunteer placement has a negative impact on spell duration relative" ([Adams et al 2018:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=9))

> "o independent job search, adding 16.6 months to the average spell on social assistance. By this measure, direct placements are the least effective of the treatments studied in the short term." ([Adams et al 2018:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=10))

> "The results show that being assigned to structured job search does not have a statistically significant effect on the probability of return within one year or two years." ([Adams et al 2018:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=10))

> "a training program has a small statistically significant effect, reducing the return probabilities by 0.7 percent within one year and by 1.1 percent in two years." ([Adams et al 2018:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=10))

> "It should be noted that assignment to either structured job search or a training program alone is more effective (by the measures of efficacy examined here) than assignment to both these programs; in this case, more is not better." ([Adams et al 2018:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=10))

> "it is possible to improve outcomes for recipients of social assistance in Ontario by emphasizing programs that are more effective in meeting objectives." ([Adams et al 2018:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ME66J838?page=10))
