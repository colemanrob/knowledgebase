## Abstract

This paper presents new information on activity-related eligibility criteria for unemployment and related benefits in OECD- and EU-countries in 2017, comparing the strictness of “demanding” elements built into unemployment benefits across countries and over time. Eligibility criteria for unemployment benefits determine what claimants need to do to successfully claim benefits initially or to continue receiving them. Benefit systems feature specific rules that define the type of job offers that claimants need to accept, requirements for reporting on the outcomes of independent job-search efforts, obligations to participate in active labour market programmes, as well as sanctions for failing to meet these requirements. Such rules aim to strengthen incentives to look for, prepare for, and accept employment. They may also be used as a targeting device to reduce demands on benefit systems, and on associated employment services. While this may serve to limit support to genuine jobseekers, strict requirements can also exclude some intended recipients from financial and re-employment support, e.g., by discouraging them from applying. This paper presents detailed information on policy rules in 2017, summarises them into an overall policy indicator of eligibility strictness, and gauges recent policy trends by documenting changes in the strictness measures. A novelty is the inclusion of lower-tier unemployment or social assistance benefits in the compilation of policy rules. Results document a large number of reforms enacted after the Great Recession and suggest a slight convergence of policy rules across countries even though overall measures of the strictness of activity-related eligibility criteria have remained broadly unchanged during the recent past. In countries with multiple layers of support for the unemployed, availability requirements tend to be more demanding for lower-tier assistance benefits, while sanction rules tend to be more stringent for first-tier programmes.

> "Available meta-evaluations suggest that job-search assistance services and benefit sanctions are effective in yielding positive employment effects, especially if job loss has been relatively recent" ([ 2018:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JHDVJ3JV?page=9))

> "These additional aspects, including how unemployed workers apply for benefits and register for placement, are not commonly considered eligibility criteria. But they nonetheless shape the accessibility of benefits and play an important part in countries' labour-market activation strategie" ([ 2018:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JHDVJ3JV?page=10))

> "for instance, shorter contribution records may be required or participation in ALMPs may generate new rights to unemployment insurance)" ([ 2018:14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JHDVJ3JV?page=14))

> "These activity-related eligibility criteria are the subject of this paper and cover (i) requirements to be available for employment, (ii) job-search and reporting requirements, and (iii) sanctions for non-compliance with applicable requirements" ([ 2018:14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JHDVJ3JV?page=14))

> "they nonetheless shape the overall activation stance and the accessibility of support for the unemployed. Jobseekers may, for instance, only be able to sign up for unemployment benefits once they have registered for job placement with an employment service provider" ([ 2018:15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JHDVJ3JV?page=15))

> "A number of studies have examined the impact of warnings and the existence of sanctions provisions generally and show that they can substantially shorten benefit claim durations and increase re-employment among individuals who may expect to incur a sanction" ([ 2018:18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JHDVJ3JV?page=18))

> "More generally, there is evidence that "soft" eligibility constraints like mandatory participation in ALMPs or gradual reductions of benefit levels over time have effects similar to those of harsher instruments like sanctions" ([ 2018:18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JHDVJ3JV?page=18))

> "employment is when they participate in ALMPs such as labour market training schemes. For instance, it might be considered more important that claimants complete their courses first rather than having to accept available jobs quickly" ([ 2018:23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JHDVJ3JV?page=23))

> "Claimants may be allowed to reject job offers if the vacancy is for an occupation that is different from their last job, or if it pays significantly lower wages." ([ 2018:23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JHDVJ3JV?page=23))

> "Claimants may also be required to commute or even relocate in order to acquire and start new employment. Many countries specify a maximum amount of time per day workplace or, alternatively, a maximum distance from their home a claimant can be required to commute to a new job."

> "In July 2016, Canada replaced the earlier rules, imposing different requirements depending on claimants' unemployment record and contribution payments. The new rules allow claimants to limit their availability to their previous occupation for a 'reasonable period' (not further defined) and at wages and conditions equal to those of their previous jobs" ([ 2018:34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JHDVJ3JV?page=34))

> "In Australia, for instance, commuting up to 90 minutes each way is considered suitable" ([ 2018:34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JHDVJ3JV?page=34))

> "In Canada, a new definition of suitable work no longer specifies explicit geographic mobility requirements (instead, in determining whether and how far unemployed workers can be expected to commute, claimant's health and physical capabilities are to be considered)" ([ 2018:34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JHDVJ3JV?page=34))

> "Canada and Denmark amended their list of valid reasons for refusing employment offers since 2014. In Canada, the list of valid reasons was condensed to one (if the prospective employer is affected by industrial disputes). The score assigned to Canada was lifted to a 5 accordingly."

They may also be used as a targeting device to reduce demands on benefit systems and employment services, by limiting support to "genuine" or "deserving" jobseekers.
